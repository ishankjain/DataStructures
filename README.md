# DataStructures

1. For each data structure add all the basic programs for insertion, deletion, search, etc.
2. For each data structure, add codes for all the questions practiced in the following structure:
	a. Interview (LeetCode, InterviewBit, etc.)
	b. Competitive (Codechef, Spoj, etc.)
3. Add comments in the code.
4. Write code in an uderstandable format.
5. For the practice problems, add the link to the problem in the comment.
6. For the practice problems, add notes for different/difficult questions for future reference and so that all the questions need not be implemented each time for revision.
